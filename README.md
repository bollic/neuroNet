Nephis is a lightweight, modular web-based system for collecting, managing, and mapping geospatial data.

Designed around the "field â†” office" model, it lets different roles collaborate:

Field users can record points and areas directly on the map.

Office users manage, review, and analyze shared data.

ðŸ§© Itâ€™s not tied to a specific use case: whether you're mapping field observations, collaborative research, or logistics, Nephis gives you a base system to build on.

Built with simplicity, clarity, and full ownership in mind.
